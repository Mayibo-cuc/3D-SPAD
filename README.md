# 3D-SPAD


## Dataset
We referenced original 3D scene data from the SUNCG dataset. Please see the [webpage](http://suncg.cs.princeton.edu) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08974v1.pdf) for more details about the data. The 3D-SPAD dataset we proposed contains graphs of 3000 scenes which stored in the JSON file.
